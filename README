*ttagecho.txt*      Show current tag information (echo area or balloon)

This plugin is similar to echofunc (vimscript #1735) to which it owes 
much inspiration and two lines of code. It displays some information 
about the tag under the cursor or mouse pointer either in the echo area 
or as balloon help (see |g:ttagecho_balloon_patterns|). If there are 
more than one tags that match, you can loop through the tags by invoking 
the respective commands repeatedly.

If hookcursormoved (vimscript #2037, version >= 0.4) is installed, for 
certain filetypes (see |g:ttagecho_parentheses_patterns|) it will 
display the information in the echo area also if the cursor moves over a 
round parenthesis.

If you don't like the default format for the tags, you can define the 
function TTagechoFormat_{&filetype}(a:tag) that should return some nicely 
formatted information.
